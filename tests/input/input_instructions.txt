To run the test cases:
- Go to MSD Shared Google Drive for door sign creation: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R_HkNobnebCh3XHPnnm5fU0EnDEmNbXh
- In the Door_Sign_Creation_Files folder, drag the MSD_Lab_Safety_DB.xlsx and QueryResult.csv files from this input folder into the 
  Door_Sign_Creation_Files folder.
- Open the Door_Sign_Script_MSD.ipynb file in Google Collab and select 'Runtime' > 'Run all'. If you are running the script on the same kernel 
  multiple times, select 'Runtime' > 'Restart session and run all'.
- When running the script, make sure to put 'msd' as the division when given the prompt.

Notes:
- Desired output to compare to is in the output folder.
- If any significant changes were made to the script, one can edit the instructions in each of the shared Drive folders:
	- MSD: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R_HkNobnebCh3XHPnnm5fU0EnDEmNbXh
	- ALS: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g2XsLofrZLZkax4NEZHGqXORQqFpG6pG
	- CSD: [in progress]
- The script also keeps an archive of Smartsheet files and inputs them into the Smartsheet_Archive folder.
- After each successful run of the script, the MSD_Lab_Safety_DB.xlsx and QueryResult.csv get reformatted 
  to OLD_smartsheet_XX_XX_XXXX and OLD_queryresult_XX_XX_XXXX.
